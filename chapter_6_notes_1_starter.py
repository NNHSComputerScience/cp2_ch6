# Chapter 6 guided notes #1: Functions

# Python lets you create your own functions.
# Functions let you break your code into managable,
#   logical chunks (think Modular Design)
#   Functions also allow you to abstract away unneccessary information.

#  Abstraction is naming parts of a program to hide all but the most
#   relevant details. Lets you think about the big picture without worrying
#   about the details.

# 1: Creating a function is reffered to as
#    "Defining a Function"


# 2: Using a function is reffered to as
#    "Calling a function"

# 3: DOCSTRING. A special way to document a function;
#    It must be triple quoted, and on the first line.  Can provide
#    useful info when attempting to use the function.

# 4: PARAMETERS: Variable names inside the parentheses of a
#      function header. A function recieves a value through its
#      parameters. Parameters catch values sent to the function
#      from a function call. 
#    ARGUMENTS: Values sent to a function to use. (put in parentheses of a 
#      function call)


# Trap... If I define a function with one parameter, then I must
#       use the same number of arguments when calling the function

# 5 You can have multiple parameters:


# 6: You can get values out of a function by returning value(s). 
#    You can return a value from a function by using
#    the RETURN STATEMENT. A function always ends after
#    executing a return statement, and the RETURN VALUE is returned.


# You can return any type of value in a function


# CHALLENGE: Can you define a function that can simulate
#           the rolling of two dies and return both values?
# CHALLENGE 2: Create a new function to add your two die rolls
#           together and return the total.
