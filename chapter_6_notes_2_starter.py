# Chapter 6 notes #2

# SCOPE defines the accessibility of separate parts of a program. Functions
#       have a local scope by default, which means variables (including parameters)
#       initialized within a function are LOCAL VARIBALES, and only exist within that particular function.


# GLOBAL vs. LOCAL SCOPE
#       GLOBAL VARIABLES initialized outside of functions are accessible throughout 
#       a program, and therefore have a global scope.
 
# Global Reach Example - demonstrates global variable access
#   define functions


# Shadowing - When a local variable has the same name as a global variable we say that the local shadows the global. 
#  A shadow means that the global variable cannot be accessed by Python because the local variable will be found first. 
#  This is another good reason not to use global variables. 


# main program 


# ENCAPSULATION - Keeps code logically independent by ‘hiding’ information from other parts of a program.
#  Functions should be written to leverage encapsulation and therefore only rely on local variables (if possible).
